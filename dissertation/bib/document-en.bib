The results provide an indication of lasing by direct injection of current into an organic thin film through selection of a high-gain organic semiconductor showing clear separation of the lasing wavelength from significant triplet and polaron absorption and design of a proper feedback structure with low losses at high current densities.

abstract = {Abstract Organic semiconducting single crystals (OSSCs) are ideal candidates for the construction of high-performance optoelectronic devices/circuits and a great platform for fundamental research due to their long-range order, absence of grain boundaries, and extremely low defect density. Impressive improvements have recently been made in organic optoelectronics: the charge-carrier mobility is now over 10 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the fluorescence efficiency reaches 90\% for many OSSCs. Moreover, high mobility and strong emission can be integrated into a single OSSC, for example, showing a mobility of up to 34 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a photoluminescence yield of 41.2\%. These achievements are attributed to the rational design and synthesis of organic semiconductors as well as improvements in preparation technology for crystals, which accelerate the application of OSSCs in devices and circuits, such as organic field-effect transistors, organic photodetectors, organic photovoltaics, organic light-emitting diodes, organic light-emitting transistors, and even electrically pumped organic lasers. In this context, an overview of these fantastic advancements in terms of the fundamental insights into developing high-performance organic semiconductors, efficient strategies for yielding desirable high-quality OSSCs, and their applications in optoelectronic devices and circuits is presented. Finally, an overview of the development of OSSCs along with current challenges and future research directions is provided.},

abstract  ="To realize low-cost fabrication processes for high-performance organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display and lighting{,} it has recently become important to understand the properties and structures of solution-processed amorphous films. In particular{,} to choose an appropriate process to produce OLEDs to meet the demands of a realistic situation{,} it is necessary to know the general advantages and disadvantages of vacuum- and solution-processed films quantitatively. However{,} the differences between the films formed by these processes are not yet sufficiently clear. Here we systematically compare vacuum-deposited and spin-coated amorphous organic semiconductor films used for OLEDs mainly by ellipsometry{,} and demonstrate the critical differences in film density{,} transition temperature{,} and molecular orientation. We found that the film density{,} transition temperature{,} and degree of horizontal molecular orientation of small-molecule spin-coated films are inherently lower than those of the corresponding vacuum-deposited ones. In addition{,} we show that the transition temperature and molecular orientation of small-molecule spin-coated films of glassy materials are identical to those of “deteriorated” vacuum-deposited films that have experienced a transition induced by heating. Our comprehensive comparisons lead to guidelines for selecting suitable processes and materials for production and clarify the future challenges to be addressed to facilitate the development of high-performance solution-processed OLEDs."}

Here{,} we report that the generalized Einstein relation (GER) can unify various theoretical models and predict charge transport in OSCs with various crystallinities{,} by altering the variance of the density of states and the delocalization degree in a Gaussian-distributed density of states. The GER also provides a good fitting to much of the experimental data of temperature- and gate-voltage-dependent mobility for different OSCs in transistors. Consequently{,} disorders of charge transport in various OSCs can be directly compared in the same map{,} which reveals how energetic disorder and the delocalization degree determine charge transport in organic devices."}

In such a hopping relaxation, neither diffusion coefficient, D, nor mobility of carriers, μ, depend on temperature and the conventional form of the Einstein's relationship μ = eDkT is not valid. The relationship between μ and D for the hopping relaxation of electrons in the exponential band tail is calculated and it is shown that it has the form μ ∝ eDϵ0, where ϵ0 is the energy scale of the exponential band tail.}

abstract = {Thermal transport in disordered organic semiconductors fundamentally differs from that in inorganic materials and is determined by the charge carriers and phonons in localized states. Understanding thermal transport performance of organic semiconductors is important for a fundamental description of energy flow and then a better design of organic thermoelectric devices. We present a unified theoretical model to describe the thermal transport performance of the disordered organic semiconductors based on hopping transport theory. The proposed model predicts that the contribution from phonon to the thermal conductivity is larger than that from charge carrier in the disordered organic semiconductors. Moreover, the proposed model can well interpret the thermal transport feature of the organic semiconductors by combining the disorder, temperature, and carrier concentration. Simulation results imply that thermal conductivity in the disordered organic semiconductors could be strongly affected under large electric field, high carrier and dopant concentration.}
